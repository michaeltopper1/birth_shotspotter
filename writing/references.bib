	abstract = {Introduction:
The objective of this study was to investigate the association
between state-level publicly expressed sentiment towards racial and ethnic
minorities and birth outcomes for mothers who gave birth in that state.

Methods:
We utilized Twitter’s Streaming Application Programming
Interface (API) to collect 1,249,653 tweets containing at least one relevant
keyword pertaining to a racial or ethnic minority group. State-level derived
sentiment towards racial and ethnic minorities were merged with data on all
2015 U.S. births (N=3.99 million singleton births).

Results:
Mothers living in states in the lowest tertile of positive sentiment
towards racial/ethnic minorities had greater prevalences of low birth weight
(+6\%), very low birth weight (+9\%), and preterm birth (+10\%) compared to
mothers living in states in the highest tertile of positive sentiment,
controlling for individual-level maternal characteristics and state
demographic characteristics. Sentiment towards specific racial/ethnic groups
showed a similar pattern. Mothers living in states in the lowest tertile of
positive sentiment towards blacks had an 8\% greater prevalence of low birth
weight and very low birth weight, and a 16\% greater prevalence of preterm
birth, compared to mothers living in states in the highest tertile. Lower
state-level positive sentiment towards Middle Eastern groups was also
associated with a 4–13\% greater prevalence of adverse birth outcomes.
Results from subgroup analyses restricted to racial/ethnic minority mothers
did not differ substantially from those seen for the full population of
mothers.

Conclusions:
More negative area-level sentiment towards blacks and Middle Eastern
groups was related to worse individual birth outcomes, and this is true for
the full population and minorities.},

This paper uses new, more accurate data on gunfire (generated by ShotSpotter audio sensors) to measure the effects of juvenile curfews in Washington, DC. Using variation in the hours of the DC curfew, we find that this policy increases gunfire incidents by 150\% during marginal hours. In contrast, voluntarily reported crime measures (such as 911 calls) suggest that the curfew decreases gun violence, likely because of confounding effects on reporting rates.},

Political scientists have investigated the ideological shifts caused by natural disasters and terrorist attacks, but no work to date has investigated the political consequences of such events using the framework of psychological trauma. In this study, I develop a theory of post-traumatic political response that explains how traumatic events aﬀect voter turnout. To test this theory, I identify the eﬀects of three diﬀerent types of traumatic events: Black Church arson attacks, mass shootings, and natural disasters. I ﬁnd that a traumatic event decreases turnout in the next presidential election by 0.5-3.7 percentage points, but Black social identity conditions this eﬀect–church arsons mobilize Black voters. Finally, I ﬁnd that closer temporal proximity to an election increases the likelihood of a mobilizing eﬀect.},

Controlling for parental income, education and social class, children who experience poor health have significantly lower educational attainment, poorer health, and lower social status as adults. Childhood health and circumstance appear to operate both through their impact on initial adult health and economic status, and through a continuing direct effect of prenatal and childhood health in middle age. Overall, our findings suggest more attention be paid to health as a potential mechanism through which intergenerational transmission of economic status takes place: cohort members born into poorer families experienced poorer childhood health, lower investments in human capital and poorer health in early adulthood, all of which are associated with lower earnings in middle age-the years in which they themselves become parents.},

	abstract = {Using national data from the U.S., we find that poor health at birth and limited parental resources (including low income, lack of health insurance, and unwanted pregnancy) interfere with cognitive development and health capital in childhood, reduce educational attainment, and lead to worse labor market and health outcomes in adulthood. These effects are substantial and robust to the inclusion of sibling fixed effects and an extensive set of controls. The results reveal that low birth weight ages people in their 30s and 40s by 12 years, increases the probability of dropping out of high school by one-third, lowers labor force participation by 5 percentage points, and reduces labor market earnings by roughly 15 percent. While poor birth outcomes reduce human capital accumulation, they explain only 10 percent of the total effect of low birth weight on labor market earnings. Taken together, the evidence is consistent with a negative reinforcing intergenerational transmission of disadvantage within the family; parental economic status influences birth outcomes, birth outcomes have long reaching effects on health and economic status in adulthood, which in turn leads to poor birth outcomes for one's own children.},

Why does this literature have a “second act?” We summarize the major themes and contributions driving the empirical literature since our 2011 reviews, and try to interpret the literature in light of an overarching conceptual framework about how human capital is produced early in life. One major finding is that relatively mild shocks in early life can have substantial negative impacts, but that the effects are often heterogeneous reflecting differences in child endowments, budget constraints, and production technologies. Moreover, shocks, investments, and interventions can interact in complex ways that are only beginning to be understood. Many advances in our knowledge are due to increasing accessibility of comprehensive administrative data that allow events in early life to be linked to long-term outcomes. Yet, we still know relatively little about the interval between, and thus about whether it would be feasible to identify and intervene with affected individuals at some point between early life and adulthood. We do know enough, however, to be able to identify some interventions that hold promise for improving child outcomes in early life and throughout the life course.},

Community violence is an understudied aspect of social context that may affect risk of preterm birth and small-for-gestational age (SGA).

Methods:
We matched California mothers with live singleton births who were exposed to a homicide in their Census tract of residence in 2007–2011 to unexposed mothers within the same tract. We estimated risk differences with a weighted linear probability model, with weights corresponding to the matched data structure. We estimated the average treatment effect on the treated of homicide exposure on the risk of preterm birth and SGA during the pre-conception period, and first and second trimester.

Results:
We found a small increase in risk of SGA associated with homicide exposure in the first trimester (0.14\% [95\% CI −0.01\%, 0.30\%]), but not for exposure during the pre-conception period (−0.01\% [95\% CI −0.17\%, 0.15\%]) or the second trimester (−0.06\% [95\% CI −0.23\%, 0.11\%]). Risk of preterm birth was not affected by homicide exposure. When women were exposed to homicides during all three exposure windows there was a larger increase in risk of SGA (1.09\% [95\% CI 0.15\%, 2.03\%]) but not PTB (0.14\% [95\% CI −0.74\%, 1.01\%]). Exposure to three or more homicides was also associated with greater risk of SGA (0.78\% [95\% CI 0.15\%, 1.40\%]). Negative controls indicated that residual confounding by temporal patterning was unlikely.

Conclusions:
Homicide exposure during early pregnancy is associated with a small increased risk of SGA.},
